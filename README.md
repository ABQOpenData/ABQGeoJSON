<h1>Project: ABQ Open Data Census</h1>

<h2>What is the ABQ Open Data Census?</h2>
<p>
The first step in making data actionable is to make sure the data is easily accessible. Many cities, whether they have an open data policy in place or not, have work to do in terms of making datasets open and available online. 
</p>
<p>
We are using the US City Census project as a starting point for evaluating the availability and doing an inventory of the open data in Albuquerque.  This will allow us to get acquainted with each other and existing data sources.  Additionally, educating ourselves of data availability will help facilitate our relationship with the city & county.
